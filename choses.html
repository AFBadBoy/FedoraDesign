    <p class="fin"><g><o class="kevin">At KEVIN.MURPHY</o></g>, we are concerned about preserving the ENVIRONMENT and aware of the imminent danger
        what climate change represents.
        We strive to contribute to respecting the environment by using recyclable and recycled packaging.
        Starting with our secondary packaging,
        for which we use exclusively paper or cardboard. We also selected
        a square bottle so as to occupy a smaller volume and offer a 40% reduction in plastic.
        KEVIN.MURPHY always goes further and invests heavily in reducing waste through
        an action dear to its DNA: recycling used plastics for the design of the packaging of our products.
        By adopting Post Consumer Recycled (PCR) technology in its production chain,
        The bottles are made from post-consumer recycled plastics, minimizing production
        of virgin plastic materials. Which allows us today to obtain a circular supply chain.
        In order to guarantee active ingredients of the highest quality, the KEVIN.MURPHY range is formulated from
        ingredients from renewable and sustainable sources,
        but also harvested using methods that cause no harm to the environment.</p>
